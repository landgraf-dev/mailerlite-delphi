# MailerLite API for Delphi

[MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com) is an e-mail marketing tool. This library is a Delphi client that communicates with the [MailerLite API](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs). It requires [TMS BIZ](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmsbizintro.asp) framework. 

Just a few endpoints were added, but it should be relatively easy to add new ones.
